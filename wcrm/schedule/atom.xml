      <![CDATA[<b>A Compilation Taken from The Road Tapes of Two Art Handlers</b> <i>Dave Herman, President and Jesse James Arnold, Web and Music Tech,</i> spent six months traveling across this fine country of ours delivering famous, heavier than you would believe artworks, to both famous places you've never heard of, and to the souless rich. <br><br>

      <![CDATA[<b>An Ongoing WCRM Covers Show</b><br><br>

<b>11.12.05. Stranger and/or Stronger</b><br><br>
