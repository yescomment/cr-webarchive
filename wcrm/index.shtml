This month, WCRM, The Citizens’ Radio Music Show starts little earlier but is bound to stay up later as the theme this month is COFFEE. We'll have this months collector Rodger Stevens in the studio for a few questions about his Paper Coffee Cup Collection. We've also asked Marshall Brain, creator and chief contributor of <a href="http://howstuffworks.com">HowStuffWorks.com</a>, to explain for us How Coffee Works?<br><br>
Throughout this broadcast we will be treated to a Selection of Music Curated by Erica Matthews, resident Coffee Coniseur. Erica also brings us movie quotes, literary refrences, and coffee facts as we dig into the cultural effects of the coffee bean.
<br><br>
Regular Contributers to the show this month include: Jesse James Arnold, Dave Herman, Mindy Abovitz and George Ferrandi.

The City Reliquary Museum presents: <br>WCRM, The Citizens’ Radio Music Show
<br>Thursday, October 6, 2005, 10:00 PM-12:00 midnight
<br><br>
This month, WCRM, The Citizens’ Radio Music Show focuses on being "Live".  As the show and crew debated our own issues of producing and broadcasting ourselves live, we decided to take it to the "show". The broadcast will look at: the histories of live performance and studio production, unique moments in musical performace when audieces talked back, live comedy on televsion that pushed censorship, artists who decided to turn away from live performace all together, and music that was born in a studio and live performace is actually the afterthought.
