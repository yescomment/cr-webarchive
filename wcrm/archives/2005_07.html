<h3 class="title">Brooklyn Barbecue: July 7. 2005</h3>

The City Reliquary Museum presents: <br>WCRM, The Citizens’ Radio Music Show<br>
Thursday, July 7, 2005, 10:00 PM-12:00 midnight<br><br>

This month, WCRM, The Citizens’ Radio Music Show celebrates the summertime joys of BBQ in the BK. That’s right folks, two steamy hours of barbecue talk and related music brought to you by your friends at The City Reliquary. <br><br>

In the hot seat this month are our featured Community Collections collector of vintage meat recipe books, Paul Lukas, and Freedom Tripodi, special guest chef of local vegan fast food joint, Foodswings.<br><br>

We will talk to these fine fellows on the topic of sauces, faux meat, and great grill secrets.
Also joining us for live rock-n-roll and barbecue trivia will be Brooklyn based band, The Besties.
Tune in friends for this and much, much more… see you all in Radio Land! 
<br><br>

Brought to you by The City Reliquary, Co-Producers Dave Herman and George Ferrandi, your host Mindy Abovitz, and Head Engineer Tianna Kennedy.
