Last year was also the 100th anniversary of the subway system which was celebrated by a ride of the entire length of the 1-9 lines.  First below ground, then above riding Broadway from the Bronx to the Battery. <br><br>

<h4>Five riders stop to represent the five boroughs at the "Crossroads of the World."  Times Square was once known as Longacre Square before the famous newspaper moved its headquarters to this neighborhood from lower Manhattan.  Times Square also celebrated its 100th birthday in 2004.  Mayor McClellen was honored to operate the first subway train from City Hall and rename Times Square in the same year, 1904. </h4></center>
