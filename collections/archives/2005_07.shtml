<h3 class="title">Sidewalk Reception</h3>

During the sidewalk reception, friends and neighbors come to the City Reliquary to view this year's "Tribute to Our City" Community Collection.  A wide variety of items have been displayed this year which pay tribute to New York while remembering September 11th.  The items on display have special meaning to their owners and show the diversity in how fellow New Yorkers remember and pay tribute to their city through the collection of personal artifacts.

<h3 class="title">Item #11 submitted by Johanna Arendt</h3>

"I moved to New York three weeks before 9/11, and I had just started seeing someone.  The day after the towers were hit, I took a backpack with clothes and some CDs and we drove in his SUV to RI where he had friends and I had family.  We were stuck in traffic for a long time and I remember listening to this CD.  Even though it was such a crazy, awful time, it was also the time when we started to really get to know each other.  He's still one of my best friends and I always think about that trip when I listen to this CD."

"When I moved to New York in October '02 I visited my aunt in her temporary office in the Woolworth building.  She had lost her building (#7) and many friends and colleagues on 9/11.  This photo of her, myself, and my brother was on her desk.  It had been in the bottom of a shoebox of snapshots, but now almost seemed like a picture of lost world."

<h3 class="title">Item #7 submitted by Grace Kline</h3>

"I bought this card in Woodside, Queens after I walked with friends over the bridge from Manhattan that day.  I felt sort of weird buying it - reacting to the events of the day with an act of commerce seemed almost blasphemous - but it still felt like the right thing to do.  I had to fold it to put it in my wallet (an oversized tooled leather mexican thing, big enough to hold foreign currency) but once that was done, I didn't give it much thought.   But in the months and years afterward, when I cleaned it out, I found I couldn't throw it away, or even put it away in my box of mementos. The tears are really just from being toted around for so long. I lose things all the time, but you know how it is, the things you think you'll surely lose because you don't need them wind up being the things you keep for the longest. Every time I opened up my wallet and cleaned it out, I would fold it back up, and put it back in. Mostly, I used it to divide business cards and membership cards, to keep security cards from demagnitizing credit cards, stuff like that. I figured I'd know what to do with it at some point. And, when [my friend] Emily told me about [this] project, I did."

<h3 class="title">Found Photo Album</h3>

This photo album was found near a garbage can and filled with photos taken at the World Trade Center.  Some photos show a proud chef in full uniform with his equally proud parents.  While the full story of this album remains a mystery, it seemed essencial to its finder that the photos not be erased from history by falling into the waste basket.  Perhaps the original owner found the images too difficult to keep, but stopped short of disposing of them completely and decided to leave them just to the side of the garbage can.  Now the annonymous finder may serve as a gaurdian of these images so that the memories they represent can survive.

"A couple of weeks before September 11th, I went into a store.  I picked up a couple of cards, advertising the release of the new Mercury Rev album on 9-11-01.  I got them to remind myself of the release.  I left them on my desk unnoticed.  Late day on September 11th I was sitting at my desk.  I realized that this random day would never be forgotten."

<h3 class="title">Item #12 submitted by Dennis Potami</h3>

"My girlfriend and I always joke about my Myers-Briggs category;  I'm an ENFP and there is something about my P that rarely allows me to feel like I've gotten enough information, history, or context about any 
subject, let alone something as incomprehensible as 9-11.  By my best 
estimates, I have probably listened to over 4000 hours of Brian Lehrer, 
Lenny Lopate, All things Considered, Etc., Etc. since 9-11 alone.  This 
radio has been a constant companion in my efforts to make sense of a 
conflicted world."

This painting was found on the sidewalk in our neighborhood of Williamsburgh, Brooklyn.  The marker graffiti is thought to be evidence of its installation at the nearby school where it was found.

"This picture was taken from the roof of the Shaefer Brewery which has since been demolished to make way for a high rise on the Williamsburgh waterfront.  This photo was taken accidentally, but I liked it so I printed it up anyway.  It took on a prophetic significance later on and always engages new eyes that fall on it."

<h3 class="title">Item #20 submitted by Bill Scanga</h3>

"Like a lot of businesses in New York City my local
grocery store uses a strange Manhattan skyline
including the Twin Towers as a symbol.  This odd
skyline was only recognizable as Manhattan because of
its Twin Towers.  The grocery store had this skyline
printed on all of its bags.  After 9/11 I wondered if
the symbol on the grocery bags would change as our
skyline had.  I noticed that the Twin Towers remained
part of the bag.  But it wasnít until this third year
memorial that I noticed the additional text.   I think
without the Twin Towers this grocery bag skyline
wouldnít look like NYC."

<h3 class="title">Item #15 submitted by George Ferrandi</h3>

"In the days after September 11, I wrote:
The top edge of a dumpster at a construction site outside Union Square is lined with lit candles. In the square itself, small white tents house volunteers who shout to the waiting crowds what supplies are needed. Very soon a line of people forms with their arms full of plastic bins and shopping bags, delivering their donations. Through the foggy plastic container, the folded, cantaloupe-colored towels are the same color as the candles on the dumpster ledge, and I cling to this color as some argument for optimism."

"I grew up learning Cello and I used a tuning fork every day to tune the A string.  It is activated by striking it against a hard object and then touching it to an instrument or surface. Upon contact the note seems to emanate from deep within the instrument, or from everywhere. After 9/11 I was exploring the Islamic architectural influences of the towers design when someone mentioned the similarity of the arches at the base of the towers to the shape of a tune fork. I came to think of the towers as the double ends of a giant tuning fork with its base buried deep into the ground. A year ago I was moving my parents into assisted living and cleaning out the last house they would own.  On a last tour of their home I discovered this tuning fork in a black case lying in the corner of a room.  It is more than likely the very tuning fork I used as a child. When Philippe Petit, the tight ropewalker who illegally transversed the tops of the World Trade Centers, stepped off the first building and onto the wire he reported that the strongest sensation was the vibration or hum of the buildings. These associations, transversing memories, make my memorial, musical towers."

<h3 class="title">Item #17 submitted by Dave Herman</h3>

"Iíve always loved the little label on Manhattan Special bottles.  It seems to be made especially for the purpose of showing off the skyline.  After September 11th, I clung to it as well as other reminders of what the skyline used to look like.  I was sad to see that recently the Manhattan Special label was changed.  It now contains an image of the Brooklyn Bridge, Chrysler and Empire State Buildings, but the Twin Towers have been erased.  Drinking Manhattan Specials feels like following in a beautiful tradition.  They are bottled here in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, they are delicious, and they scream civic pride.  Now, instead of the immediate smile, I feel slightly disappointed when I reach for one in the cooler at our pizzeria."

"On August 21, 2004, I went down to the World Trade Center to join a group of people on a walk to Madison Square Garden.  This walk was to serve as a symbol of the peopleís disapproval of the use of September 11th as a campaign strategy during the Republican National Convention.  I felt let down by our cityís representatives and needed to find a way to represent myself and other citizens like me.  I sought to do this in a peaceful and law abiding way with more than 200 other people.  We followed direction given by authorities, only to be trapped on the sidewalk, just steps away from ground zero.  We were brought to holding cells on Pier 57 in order to contain us and prevent our statement.  There, I was given these two rations of milk which were ironically imprinted with the date; SEPT 11."

<h3 class="title">Item #10 submitted by Christy Gast</h3>

"On September 13, 2001, I began teaching art at Shonto Preparatory School on the Navajo Nation. Many of my young students had brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles in the military, so the events of September 11 and the ensuing war in Afghanistan weighed heavily on their minds. In January of 2002, I had my 2nd and 3rd grade students design posters for National Book Month. The students chose a topic or a book to promote with an advertising campaign. Although months had passed and New York is so far removed from the Rez that it might as well be on another planet, several of the children's posters proclaimed "Read About New York" or "Read About Lady Liberty". None of the New York posters was without a graphic depiction of an airplane crashing into the twin towers. In this poster, there is hogan, a traditional Navajo house that is round or octagonal and made of logs and mud, perched on top of one of the towers. The idiosyncrasies in this drawing remind me that children understand the entire world through the lens of their own experience. Of course there are hogans in New York, and of course the Statue of Liberty looks like a Navajo woman."

<h3 class="title">Item #21 submitted by Jesse James Arnold</h3>

On the morning of September 11th, Jesse Arnold was running his daily errands at a large franchise electronics store in San Diego, California when images from New York began filling a wall of television screens.  Confused by the unfathomable streams of information, he transfixed on another customerís purchase in front of him.  The transaction included a computer mouse that became embedded in his mind.  At that moment of uncertainty and disbelief, a small tangible object was at least something clearly real to cling to.

"49.30.440.6302<br>
Telephone number of Meck Maaﬂ, and subsequently, my own former 
telephone number in Berlin.  On the early morning of September 11, we 
were having our monthly catch-up when he suddenly exclaimed "Turn 
your television on, turn it on!" and we both watched the events of 
that morning happen live from 2 separate televisions on 2 separate 
continents.

"This Statue of Liberty lighter was purchased pre 9/11
as a novelty lighter.  The Twin Towers on the
packaging were barely noticeable at the time.   Like
all images of the Towers, after 9/11 they became very
noticeable. The lighter and itís packaging were
transformed after 9/11 from a Statute of Liberty
chachka into a personal World Trade Center memorial
for me."

"This is the flag that I chose to fly following September 11th.  Then, it seemed to have a different meaning, especially in New York.  It served as a symbol of mourning and solidarity.  A symbol that regardless of all of our individual backgrounds, we were experiencing these events together - people united in one of the most diverse cities in the world.  Flags hung from every building in the city like honorable Purple Heart badges.  The city was wounded but prouder now more than ever.

This is a drawing which proposes a new World Trade Center by Jabiel Jimenez.  Jabiel has created many new visions of how the World Trade Center could be rebuilt to symbolize the strength of the city.  The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has acknowledged his proposals.  Jabiel has lived on our block at Havemeyer and Grand Streets for over 30 years and was the first exhibitor in our Community Collections window.

<h3 class="title">E.T. and Vintage Glassware Collections</h3>

Bill's E.T. collection includes hundreds of figurines, plaster lamps, and homemade effigies.  This collection began as a parenthetical project of the Museum for the Collection of Extra-terrestrial Biological Entity Figurines or MCEBEF for short.

During the sidewalk reception, guests were greeted by a giant alien.  This photo was taken at the first of our now traditional pinata celebrations.  To gain a little advantage over the neighborhood kids, Bill has commandeered the alien's massive hands for better grip on the pinata stick.

A view of the window display, filled with well over 100 E.T. figurines and as many vintage glass vases as we could fit.  More than a year later, people continue to stop by the Reliquary and reminisce over this display and the giant alien who greeted guests at one of our first official sidewalk receptions.

This may be one of the most obscure artifacts in the collection.  Here, an anonymous artisan has crafted his own E.T. figure from found seashells.  Another item in the collection features an E.T. made from welded nuts and bolts!

These glass vases, popular in the 1960's, are known to insiders as "swung glass."  While the glass is molten, it is poured into a mold and then swung by hand in order to let the hot glass ooze out of the open mold.  The effect is a drooping, and surprisingly other-worldly object which compliments the extra-terrestrial objects quite nicely.
