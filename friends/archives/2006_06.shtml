<h3 class="title">Links from the Neighborhood</h3>

Here is a list of some our members' outside projects and some of our frineds from the neighborhood.  We're still under construction here at the virtual Reliquary.  So, please drop us a line if you'd like your link included.<br><br>

First of all, the City Reliquary web designer, Jesse James Arnold, is certainly not earning his income from this non-profit organization.  He has however started a successful furniture design company with two other friends of ours, Sam Kragiel and Nikki Frazier.  They are proud members of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. <br> http://www.bravespacedesign.com<br>
You can also see more examples of Jesse's virtual web work at http://www.mistermachine.com<br><br>

V.P. George Ferrandi is also a gifted statue restoration artist.  Check out her site for the best saint salvation in the North Eastern region.  Really.
