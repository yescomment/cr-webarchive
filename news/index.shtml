<div class="blogentry">
<div class="blogbody">
<p><img alt="postcard.jpg.jpeg" src="http://cityreliquary.com/frontpage/archives/postcard.jpg.jpeg" width="450" height="629" border="0" /><br /><br />
Have you seen  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3433613278_471029e272_o.png">these prefab structures</a>? Aren't they cool?<br /><br />
They're located on the Flushing Bay Promenade in Queens, a few hundred yards from the Mets' new stadium. Millions of people have seen them over the past 45 years, but almost nobody knows anything about them.<br /><br />
The Candela Structures: A New York City History Mystery, a new exhibition at the City Reliquary, tells the story of these underappreciated fiberglass formations and the surprising culture of mystery and misinformation surrounding them, from their origins as  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3411717373_3c36719a47_b.jpg">exhibit spaces</a> during the   <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3430305916_cc788b59d5_o.jpg">1964 World's Fair</a> to their current status as neglected but enduring landmarks on the Queens waterfront.<br /><br />
The exhibit has been produced by journalist Paul Lukas and architect Kirsten Hively, who developed a crush on the Candela Structures last year and decided to investigate their backstory. What began as a quick research project turned into an eight-month odyssey of dead ends, wrong turns, and architectural obsession. The resulting exhibit should give these underrated structures the attention they've long deserved.<br /><br />
The exhibit will kick off with an opening reception on May 16th, 7pm, at the City Reliquary. Arts and crafts materials will be provided, so guests can sculpt their own Candela Structures, and the Reliquary will also provide "Save the Candelas" letters and envelopes, so guests can petition city officials to provide the Candelas with sorely needed repairs. Beer and other refreshments will be provided, and DJ Stacher will kick out the jams with mid-1960s pop-garage, psychedelia and Shea Stadium live concert hits.<br /><br />
The Candela Structures: A New York City History Mystery will remain on view at the Reliquary through June 28th.<br /></p>

<div class="blogentry">
<div class="blogbody">
<p><strong>Over Spilt Milk: The Fight for Fair Price and Fair Profit in Depression Era New York.</strong><br /><br /><strong>January 30th - May 3rd 2009</strong><br><br>Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative pamphlets and broadsides, vintage milk cartons, and miniature dioramas on display.<br /><br />The show will feature documents and artifacts from the 1930s, when immigrant Meyer Parodneck and a handful of anti-poverty activists founded the Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative to ensure farmers received a fair price, and consumers paid a fair price, for milk. The Co-op played a pivotal role opening the market controlled by milk distribution giants. With their own processing plants and distribution stations, the Consumer-Farmer Co-op sold milk to consumers at the lowest possible price, and paid farmers the highest possible return, for nearly fifty years. Overcoming a mountain of obstacles, this organization made a difference to hundreds of struggling farmers and to the children of low-income New Yorkers.<br /><br />The exhibition includes period Co-op newsletters and advertising campaigns, vintage paper milk containers, and cooperative movement propaganda. Pivotal moments in the Co-op's story are illustrated with miniature dioramas.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="blogentry">
<div class="blogbody">
<p>Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser!<br />
Friday February 27th 7-11pm<br><br>Times are tough all around – rollercoaster stock markets, job losses by the hundreds of thousands, bipartisan bickering with no relief in sight. It’s even tougher for 501 (c) (3) non-profit Community Museums. So the City Reliquary is hosting a fundraiser to raise some of (last month’s!) rent. BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE SOME RENT? is a Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser held in our backroom and backyard. For a minimum $10 tax-deductible donation at the door, you can come and participate in scores of historical diversions and entertainments circa 1935.<br><br>The City Reliquary is proud to present:<br><br><strong>Pie the Landlord! That’s right</strong>: the City Reliquary will have our very own cigar-chomping, unshaven, smelly Landlord demanding our rent! Tell him where to shove it with a whipped cream pie in his face!<br /><br /><strong>Madame LuLu LoLo, Fortune Teller Extraordinaire</strong>: She Sees All and Knows All and Your Fortune Might Help Pay Our Rent!<br /><br /><strong>Hobo Photos a Go-G</strong>o: Take your picture in our hand painted carnival sign.  Remember the Recession of ’09 with a photographic keepsake!<br /><br /><strong>Depression-era movies</strong>: shown on the projector in the backyard. Laugh it up with Mae West, the Marx Brothers and James Cagney.<br /><br /><strong>Oil drum fires</strong>: (and more modern propane heaters) to keep you warm while you chill in the cold. All fires will be regulated carefully by official FDNY supervision! <br /><br /><strong>DIY Fingerless Gloves Table!</strong> Because nothing says Depression-chic than rockin’ a pair of fingerless gloves!<br /><br /><strong>Prohibition-era Beer</strong> provided by the Brooklyn Brewery and Depression-era “Rum” Punch provided by the City Reliquary at contemporary-recession era prices.<br /><br /><strong>DJ Stacher</strong> playing hits from the economically challenged 1930s (Harlem Jazz) and 1970s (early Rap); as well as Big Money tracks from the 1980s (disco) and 2000s (electro). Get down!<br /><br /><p>All entertainments and diversions will be priced at the Depression-friendly rates of $2-5 a pop. All proceeds go to help the City Reliquary pay (last month’s, and this one’s) rent. </p><br /><br /></p>
