<h3 class="title">2nd Annual Collectors' Night 2006</h3>

<p>Sunday, April 9th at 5:00 PM</p>

<p>Friends,<br />
If you thought the Grand Opening of the City Reliquary Museum was a big event... You haven't seen <br />
anything yet!<br />
Collectors' Night 2006 has been rapidly shaping up to easily surpass last year's expectations.  There will be <br />
collectors of all kinds setting up their displays for your enjoyment and a special presentation which will give <br />
amazing new insite to the wide world of collecting.  Union Pool has agreed to open up their entire space to <br />
allow for the displays to expand into the front room as well as the outdoor area (weather permitting).  This <br />
has allowed us to accept some incredible last minute additions to the line up of collectors.  I assure you, <br />
this year's event is not to be missed!  All the information is just below.<br />
Hope to see you Sunday.<br />
Always civic,<br />
Dave  <br />
