<h3 class="title">Over Spilt Milk Ending on May 10th</h3>

<p><strong>Over Spilt Milk: The Fight for Fair Price and Fair Profit in Depression Era New York.</strong><br /><br /><strong>January 30th - May 3rd 2009</strong><br><br>Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative pamphlets and broadsides, vintage milk cartons, and miniature dioramas on display.<br /><br />The show will feature documents and artifacts from the 1930s, when immigrant Meyer Parodneck and a handful of anti-poverty activists founded the Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative to ensure farmers received a fair price, and consumers paid a fair price, for milk. The Co-op played a pivotal role opening the market controlled by milk distribution giants. With their own processing plants and distribution stations, the Consumer-Farmer Co-op sold milk to consumers at the lowest possible price, and paid farmers the highest possible return, for nearly fifty years. Overcoming a mountain of obstacles, this organization made a difference to hundreds of struggling farmers and to the children of low-income New Yorkers.<br /><br />The exhibition includes period Co-op newsletters and advertising campaigns, vintage paper milk containers, and cooperative movement propaganda. Pivotal moments in the Co-op's story are illustrated with miniature dioramas.<br /><br /></p>
