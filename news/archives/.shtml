<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Happy Presidents' Day.  When current presidential turmoil troubles you, turn to the folks at the City Reliquary.  We <br />
have been working hard on the new City Reliquary Museum at 370 Metropolitan Av.  While we aren't yet fully prepared <br />
to open our doors, we would like to offer you a special event to honor presidents, collectors, artists, and of course <br />
most importantly, our beautiful new windows!</p>

<p>The City Reliquary Inaugural Sidewalk Reception<br />
FEATURING:<br />
Pedro Genao's Abraham Lincoln Statue,<br />
Christy Gast's Collectible Presidents' Plates<br />
and honoring the first African-American female presidential candidate, Charlene Mitchell<br />
AT:<br />
The new City Reliquary windows at <br />
370 METROPOLITAN AVENUE at Havemeyer Street<br />
ON:<br />
Sunday, February 26th beginning promptly at 12:00 noon<br />
SERVING:<br />
Civic pride, honorary degrees, and delicious refreshments.</p>

<p>Our featured presentation will include:<br />
A special appearance by our honored guest, CHARLENE MITCHELL.  <br />
Ms. Mitchell, the first African-American woman to run for President, represented the Communist Party in 1968.  A civil <br />
rights activist for over 50 years, Ms. Mitchell is also the founding National Coordinator of the Committee of <br />
Correspondence for Socialism and Democracy. She serves as national co-chair of the National Alliance Against Racist <br />
and Political Repression, the organization that grew out of the campaign to free Angela Davis. A portrait of Ms. <br />
Mitchell was included in a large wall mural called "When Women Pursue Justice," which was recently completed by <br />
Artmakers, Inc. at 498 Greene Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  She will be honored with a special presentation by our <br />
presenter of Presidential Plates, Christy Gast.</p>

<p>A collection presented by CHRISTY GAST <br />
of COLLECTIBLE PRESIDENTIAL PLATES with <br />
Limited Edition LADY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES Collectible Plates 2004<br />
In honor of the 2004 campaign season, Ms. Gast created a set of Limited Edition Lady Presidential Candidates <br />
Collectible Plates, featuring the first ten women to run for President. The candidates and their stories are largely <br />
unknown, although a number of them were major players in their times.  Some of those included are: Victoria <br />
Woodhull, whose running mate was Frederick Douglass, was the first female stockbroker on Wall Street. Margaret <br />
Smith, Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, and Patsy Mink all served in the legislature in the mid-twentieth century, and <br />
Charlene Mitchell, a native New Yorker, has been a civil rights activist and union leader for 50 years. Thanks to Melissa <br />
Memory, Rodney Harrison, and Kevin Harper for generously lending their collections of original collectible Presidential <br />
Plates.</p>

<p>PEDRO GENAO's Life-size Abraham Lincoln Statue <br />
made of 100% hand-felted wool.<br />
Pedro moved to New York in 1992 from the Dominican Republic and soon became employed as a Maintenance <br />
Technician at the Steiner School, a part of the Waldorf school system.  There he watched some of the teachers' craft <br />
presentations working with wool.  He has since taught himself many finer techniques of NEEDLE FELTING and is now <br />
considered to be easily among the best in his field.  The Abraham Lincoln statue presented in our windows was <br />
created by Pedro during the course of 3 years and over 300 hours.  Pedro estimates that the statue was pointed with <br />
a single needle over 3 million times.  As he should be, Abraham is standing tall at over 6 feet 4 inches not including <br />
his 9-inch top hat and supports his own weight with absolutely NO INTERNAL ARMATURE.         </p>

<p>CITY RELIQUARY ON TV!<br />
This FRIDAY February 24th, our hometown news channel NY1 will feature a story about the City Reliquary,<br />
LIVE at 7am, 8am, and with recorded highlights throughout the day.</p>

<p>NEXT MONTH: <br />
The Grand Opening Celebration of the City Reliquary Museum<br />
and the 2nd Annual Collectors' Night, at Union Pool</p>

<p>We'll keep you posted with the final dates for these two exciting events!<br />
Thank you for your support.<br />

<div class="blogentry">

<br>

<div class="blogbody">
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
 <br />
 As of January 1st at 12 o'clock midnight, we all ushered in the new year 2006 <br />
 (happy new year to all of you.)  At this same time, we at the City Reliquary, have also ushered in a new era in our mission to serve the people of New York City.  Effective today, January 1st 2006,<br />
 I am astoundingly proud to announce...<br />
 <strong><br />
 THE CITY RELIQUARY will be opening a new storefront MUSEUM <br />
(with gift shop!)<br />
 at 370 METROPOLITAN AVENUE at HAVEMEYER STREET,<br />
 just 2 blocks away from our current residence!<br />
  </strong><br />
 <br />
 This means GREAT OPPORTUNITIES for our museum and the scope of COMMUNITY OFFERINGS which we have dreamed of and planned for so long.  Soon to come will be: a museum dedicated to preserving and displaying the artifacts of New York History which often go overlooked by those larger museums, a public space for community events, an office for our Civic Organization meetings, educational classes, and neighborhood comradery, as well as a quintessential Museum Gift Shop complete with unique New York souvenirs, books, hand-made keepsakes, and the original "City Reliquary T-Shirt." Rest assured, this will not be another Williamsburgh boutique.  We'll be maintaining our window-museum style charm on Metropolitan Avenue as well as part of our displays on Grand Street and all the other things you love about the Reliquary.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 At this time of great new beginnings, I want to extend SINCERE APPRECIATION to all of our SUPPORTERS.  It is due to all your enthusiasm, involvement, and endurance of these e-mailings, that we have been able to begin this next step as a civic organization for-the-people, not-for-profit!<br />
 <br />
 OPENING DAY of new facility will be within the next few months, and we will be sure to invite the entire neighborhood to celebrate with us.  In the mean time, feel free to stop by and witness the MUSEUM-IN-PROGRESS.  <br />
