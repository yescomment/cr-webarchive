<p>Announcing the City Reliquary's first Summer Benefit Party! <br />
We hope you will join us for this delightful evening benefiting everyone's <br />
favorite community museum on <strong>July 31</strong> at <strong>7:00pm</strong>. <br />
Please email cityreliquary@gmail.com to reserve your tickets<br />
as soon as possible! Tickets are $50 (civic level) or $100<br />
(metropolitan level -- includes a Reliquary membership!).</p>

<p>In addition to enjoying drinks, snacks, and music while exploring the<br />
Reliquary and its grounds, the evening will include a silent auction<br />
featuring swag from Crest Hardware and Transportation Alternatives, a<br />
personalized NYC tour from The Levy's Unique New York!, original<br />
