<h3 class="title">September Tribute to Our City - Saturday, September 9th 12:00 - 6:00 PM</h3>

<p>Every year the City Reliquary organizes a <strong>"Tribute to Our City"</strong> in honor of the strength and unity New Yorkers demonstrated surrounding the events of September 11th, 2001. We close down a block of Havemeyer Street, have a neighborhood-wide potluck lunch, listen to live local bands play and offer you a chance to meet your neighbors.  We need all the grills and chefs we can get together.  So, bring out your BBQ equipment, or if you can loan some equipment for the day please contact george@cityreliquary.org.  If you know a band, speaker, or performer who would like to participate, please contact dave@cityreliquary.org.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Saturday, September 9th from 12:00 to 6:00 PM</strong> <strong>on Havemeyer Street between Grand St. & Metropolitan Av.<br />
</strong><u><em>INCLUDING</em> </u><br />
Appearances by Manhattan Borough Historian <strong>Mike Miscione</strong>, Brooklyn Poet Laureat <strong>Ken Siegelman</strong>,  live bands, Brooklyn <strong>street games</strong>, <strong>FDNY</strong> Fire Safety Education, <strong>free food</strong> all day, and much more in the works.<br />
