<h3 class="title">Sat. 3/24 Don't DEMO Domino Bake Sale and Q & A</h3>

<p>     Join the Waterfront Preservation Alliance at the City Reliquary on Saturday, March 24th from 7 – 9pm for an informal chat over cookies, cakes and other delectables baked with Brooklyn’s own Domino Sugar. WPA is a neighborhood-based organization that has been working for the past year to identify and designate historic structures in Greenpoint & Williamsburg, which are undergoing major changes that will dramatically change the face of our neighborhoods. As we move forward into the future of Greenpoint & Williamsburg, our aim is to ensure that vital connections to the past are retained through the preservation, reuse and rehabilitation of the historic buildings that define the character of our neighborhood. Members of the WPA will give short informal yet informative talks on the future of the Domino Sugar Factory and answer community questions. Tea, coffee and baked goods will be available for purchase at affordable prices. </p>
