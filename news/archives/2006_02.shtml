<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Happy Presidents' Day.  When current presidential turmoil troubles you, turn to the folks at the City Reliquary.  We <br />
have been working hard on the new City Reliquary Museum at 370 Metropolitan Av.  While we aren't yet fully prepared <br />
to open our doors, we would like to offer you a special event to honor presidents, collectors, artists, and of course <br />
most importantly, our beautiful new windows!</p>

<p>The City Reliquary Inaugural Sidewalk Reception<br />
FEATURING:<br />
Pedro Genao's Abraham Lincoln Statue,<br />
Christy Gast's Collectible Presidents' Plates<br />
and honoring the first African-American female presidential candidate, Charlene Mitchell<br />
AT:<br />
The new City Reliquary windows at <br />
370 METROPOLITAN AVENUE at Havemeyer Street<br />
ON:<br />
Sunday, February 26th beginning promptly at 12:00 noon<br />
SERVING:<br />
Civic pride, honorary degrees, and delicious refreshments.</p>

<p>Our featured presentation will include:<br />
A special appearance by our honored guest, CHARLENE MITCHELL.  <br />
Ms. Mitchell, the first African-American woman to run for President, represented the Communist Party in 1968.  A civil <br />
rights activist for over 50 years, Ms. Mitchell is also the founding National Coordinator of the Committee of <br />
Correspondence for Socialism and Democracy. She serves as national co-chair of the National Alliance Against Racist <br />
and Political Repression, the organization that grew out of the campaign to free Angela Davis. A portrait of Ms. <br />
Mitchell was included in a large wall mural called "When Women Pursue Justice," which was recently completed by <br />
Artmakers, Inc. at 498 Greene Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  She will be honored with a special presentation by our <br />
presenter of Presidential Plates, Christy Gast.</p>

<p>A collection presented by CHRISTY GAST <br />
of COLLECTIBLE PRESIDENTIAL PLATES with <br />
Limited Edition LADY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES Collectible Plates 2004<br />
In honor of the 2004 campaign season, Ms. Gast created a set of Limited Edition Lady Presidential Candidates <br />
Collectible Plates, featuring the first ten women to run for President. The candidates and their stories are largely <br />
unknown, although a number of them were major players in their times.  Some of those included are: Victoria <br />
Woodhull, whose running mate was Frederick Douglass, was the first female stockbroker on Wall Street. Margaret <br />
Smith, Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, and Patsy Mink all served in the legislature in the mid-twentieth century, and <br />
Charlene Mitchell, a native New Yorker, has been a civil rights activist and union leader for 50 years. Thanks to Melissa <br />
Memory, Rodney Harrison, and Kevin Harper for generously lending their collections of original collectible Presidential <br />
Plates.</p>

<p>PEDRO GENAO's Life-size Abraham Lincoln Statue <br />
made of 100% hand-felted wool.<br />
Pedro moved to New York in 1992 from the Dominican Republic and soon became employed as a Maintenance <br />
Technician at the Steiner School, a part of the Waldorf school system.  There he watched some of the teachers' craft <br />
presentations working with wool.  He has since taught himself many finer techniques of NEEDLE FELTING and is now <br />
considered to be easily among the best in his field.  The Abraham Lincoln statue presented in our windows was <br />
created by Pedro during the course of 3 years and over 300 hours.  Pedro estimates that the statue was pointed with <br />
a single needle over 3 million times.  As he should be, Abraham is standing tall at over 6 feet 4 inches not including <br />
his 9-inch top hat and supports his own weight with absolutely NO INTERNAL ARMATURE.         </p>

<p>CITY RELIQUARY ON TV!<br />
This FRIDAY February 24th, our hometown news channel NY1 will feature a story about the City Reliquary,<br />
LIVE at 7am, 8am, and with recorded highlights throughout the day.</p>

<p>NEXT MONTH: <br />
The Grand Opening Celebration of the City Reliquary Museum<br />
and the 2nd Annual Collectors' Night, at Union Pool</p>

<p>We'll keep you posted with the final dates for these two exciting events!<br />
Thank you for your support.<br />
