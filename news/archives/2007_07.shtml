<p><strong>Macaroni and Mal Occio by LuLu LoLo</strong><br />
Food, Faith, and Family - Growing up Italian American</p>

<p>Recapturing the love, laughter, and tears of her Italian-American childhood in East Harlem’s Little Italy, LuLu LoLo in a virtuoso performance—without intermission—and with inventive costume changes and songs—fills the stage with a non-stop parade of eleven family characters and vignettes such as Making Macaroni with Grandma LuLu, Great Aunt Lena Warding off the Evil Eye (Mal Occhio), The Seven Fishes of Christmas Eve Dinner and other scenes which  take the  audience back to the tenement life of her Italian immigrant grandparents. Theatergoers from all backgrounds will recognize themselves and their families in this poignant, exhilarating, and heartwarming show.  <br />
The first production of this play was performed in Williamsburgh at the Leonard  Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library in 2002.  For a review of Macaroni and Mal Occio by Arlene McKanic, Greenwich Village Gazette  go to www.hoast.org/artists/artistsLL.htm - 14k –</p>
