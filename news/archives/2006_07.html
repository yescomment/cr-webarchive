<p>Rest Assured that the City Reliquary will be participating in this amazing insider's weekend:</p>

<p>The 4th Annual openhousenewyork (OHNY) Weekend will be held on Saturday and Sunday, October 7 & 8, 2006. Nearly 200 sites in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island are gearing up to show an expected 75,000 visitors why New York is one of the greatest cities in the world!

<h3 class="title">September Tribute to Our City</h3>

<p>Every year the City Reliquary organizes a tribute to our city in honor of the strength and unity New Yorkers demonstrated surrounding the events of September 11th, 2001. We close down a block of Havemeyer Street, have a neighborhood-wide potluck lunch, listen to live local bands play and offer you a chance to meet your neighbors.  We'll be posting details about this year's event in the next few days, so check back to find out which weekend in September you and your family and friends should come join us.  We're already trying to track down grills for use that day, so if you have one you can loan us, drop a line to: george@cityreliquary.org.   </p>
