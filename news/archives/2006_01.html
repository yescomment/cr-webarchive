<h3 class="title">THE NEW CITY RELIQUARY MUSEUM</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
 <br />
 As of January 1st at 12 o'clock midnight, we all ushered in the new year 2006 <br />
 (happy new year to all of you.)  At this same time, we at the City Reliquary, have also ushered in a new era in our mission to serve the people of New York City.  Effective today, January 1st 2006,<br />
 I am astoundingly proud to announce...<br />
 <strong><br />
 THE CITY RELIQUARY will be opening a new storefront MUSEUM <br />
(with gift shop!)<br />
 at 370 METROPOLITAN AVENUE at HAVEMEYER STREET,<br />
 just 2 blocks away from our current residence!<br />
  </strong><br />
 <br />
 This means GREAT OPPORTUNITIES for our museum and the scope of COMMUNITY OFFERINGS which we have dreamed of and planned for so long.  Soon to come will be: a museum dedicated to preserving and displaying the artifacts of New York History which often go overlooked by those larger museums, a public space for community events, an office for our Civic Organization meetings, educational classes, and neighborhood comradery, as well as a quintessential Museum Gift Shop complete with unique New York souvenirs, books, hand-made keepsakes, and the original "City Reliquary T-Shirt." Rest assured, this will not be another Williamsburgh boutique.  We'll be maintaining our window-museum style charm on Metropolitan Avenue as well as part of our displays on Grand Street and all the other things you love about the Reliquary.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 At this time of great new beginnings, I want to extend SINCERE APPRECIATION to all of our SUPPORTERS.  It is due to all your enthusiasm, involvement, and endurance of these e-mailings, that we have been able to begin this next step as a civic organization for-the-people, not-for-profit!<br />
 <br />
 OPENING DAY of new facility will be within the next few months, and we will be sure to invite the entire neighborhood to celebrate with us.  In the mean time, feel free to stop by and witness the MUSEUM-IN-PROGRESS.  <br />
 <br />
