Thursday, November 3, 2005, 8:00 - 10:00 PM <br>
WCRM - The Citizens' Radio Music Station</strong><br>
LIVE Broadcast of <strong>The Coffee Show</strong> on <a href="http://cityreliquary.org">www.cityreliquary.org</a href="http://cityreliquary.org"><br>
This month, WCRM starts a little earlier but is bound to stay up later as the theme this month is COFFEE. We'll have this month's collector Rodger Stevens in the studio for a few questions about his display of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2005/06/26/nyregion/20050626_CUPS_SLIDESHOW_1.html"><em>NYC Paper Coffee Cups</em></a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2005/06/26/nyregion/20050626_CUPS_SLIDESHOW_1.html"> in our Community Collections window. We've also asked Marshall Brain, creator and chief contributor of <a href="http://howstuffworks.com">HowStuffWorks.com</a href="http://howstuffworks.com">, to explain for us <em>"How Coffee Works."</em>
  Throughout this broadcast we will be treated to a selection of music curated by Erica Matthews, resident Coffee Connoisseur. Erica also brings us movie quotes, literary references, and coffee facts as we dig into the cultural effects of the coffee bean. 
Regular contributers to the show this month include: Jesse James Arnold, Dave Herman, Mindy Abovitz and George Ferrandi. <br><br>
Write to wcrm@cityreliquary.org for more info, music requests, feedback, and other comments.
