<div class="blogentry">

<div class="blogbody">
<p><img alt="postcard.jpg.jpeg" src="http://cityreliquary.com/frontpage/archives/postcard.jpg.jpeg" width="450" height="629" border="0" /><br /><br />
Have you seen  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3433613278_471029e272_o.png">these prefab structures</a>? Aren't they cool?<br /><br />
They're located on the Flushing Bay Promenade in Queens, a few hundred yards from the Mets' new stadium. Millions of people have seen them over the past 45 years, but almost nobody knows anything about them.<br /><br />
The Candela Structures: A New York City History Mystery, a new exhibition at the City Reliquary, tells the story of these underappreciated fiberglass formations and the surprising culture of mystery and misinformation surrounding them, from their origins as  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3411717373_3c36719a47_b.jpg">exhibit spaces</a> during the   <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3430305916_cc788b59d5_o.jpg">1964 World's Fair</a> to their current status as neglected but enduring landmarks on the Queens waterfront.<br /><br />
The exhibit has been produced by journalist Paul Lukas and architect Kirsten Hively, who developed a crush on the Candela Structures last year and decided to investigate their backstory. What began as a quick research project turned into an eight-month odyssey of dead ends, wrong turns, and architectural obsession. The resulting exhibit should give these underrated structures the attention they've long deserved.<br /><br />
The exhibit will kick off with an opening reception on May 16th, 7pm, at the City Reliquary. Arts and crafts materials will be provided, so guests can sculpt their own Candela Structures, and the Reliquary will also provide "Save the Candelas" letters and envelopes, so guests can petition city officials to provide the Candelas with sorely needed repairs. Beer and other refreshments will be provided, and DJ Stacher will kick out the jams with mid-1960s pop-garage, psychedelia and Shea Stadium live concert hits.<br /><br />
The Candela Structures: A New York City History Mystery will remain on view at the Reliquary through June 28th.<br /></p>

<a name="000491"></a>

<div class="blogbody">
<p><strong>Over Spilt Milk: The Fight for Fair Price and Fair Profit in Depression Era New York.</strong><br /><br /><strong>January 30th - May 3rd 2009</strong><br><br>Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative pamphlets and broadsides, vintage milk cartons, and miniature dioramas on display.<br /><br />The show will feature documents and artifacts from the 1930s, when immigrant Meyer Parodneck and a handful of anti-poverty activists founded the Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative to ensure farmers received a fair price, and consumers paid a fair price, for milk. The Co-op played a pivotal role opening the market controlled by milk distribution giants. With their own processing plants and distribution stations, the Consumer-Farmer Co-op sold milk to consumers at the lowest possible price, and paid farmers the highest possible return, for nearly fifty years. Overcoming a mountain of obstacles, this organization made a difference to hundreds of struggling farmers and to the children of low-income New Yorkers.<br /><br />The exhibition includes period Co-op newsletters and advertising campaigns, vintage paper milk containers, and cooperative movement propaganda. Pivotal moments in the Co-op's story are illustrated with miniature dioramas.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="blogentry">
<a name="000489"></a>

<div class="blogbody">
<p>Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser!<br />
Friday February 27th 7-11pm<br><br>Times are tough all around – rollercoaster stock markets, job losses by the hundreds of thousands, bipartisan bickering with no relief in sight. It’s even tougher for 501 (c) (3) non-profit Community Museums. So the City Reliquary is hosting a fundraiser to raise some of (last month’s!) rent. BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE SOME RENT? is a Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser held in our backroom and backyard. For a minimum $10 tax-deductible donation at the door, you can come and participate in scores of historical diversions and entertainments circa 1935.<br><br>The City Reliquary is proud to present:<br><br><strong>Pie the Landlord! That’s right</strong>: the City Reliquary will have our very own cigar-chomping, unshaven, smelly Landlord demanding our rent! Tell him where to shove it with a whipped cream pie in his face!<br /><br /><strong>Madame LuLu LoLo, Fortune Teller Extraordinaire</strong>: She Sees All and Knows All and Your Fortune Might Help Pay Our Rent!<br /><br /><strong>Hobo Photos a Go-G</strong>o: Take your picture in our hand painted carnival sign.  Remember the Recession of ’09 with a photographic keepsake!<br /><br /><strong>Depression-era movies</strong>: shown on the projector in the backyard. Laugh it up with Mae West, the Marx Brothers and James Cagney.<br /><br /><strong>Oil drum fires</strong>: (and more modern propane heaters) to keep you warm while you chill in the cold. All fires will be regulated carefully by official FDNY supervision! <br /><br /><strong>DIY Fingerless Gloves Table!</strong> Because nothing says Depression-chic than rockin’ a pair of fingerless gloves!<br /><br /><strong>Prohibition-era Beer</strong> provided by the Brooklyn Brewery and Depression-era “Rum” Punch provided by the City Reliquary at contemporary-recession era prices.<br /><br /><strong>DJ Stacher</strong> playing hits from the economically challenged 1930s (Harlem Jazz) and 1970s (early Rap); as well as Big Money tracks from the 1980s (disco) and 2000s (electro). Get down!<br /><br /><p>All entertainments and diversions will be priced at the Depression-friendly rates of $2-5 a pop. All proceeds go to help the City Reliquary pay (last month’s, and this one’s) rent. </p><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Macaroni and Mal Occio by LuLu LoLo</strong><br />
Food, Faith, and Family - Growing up Italian American</p>

<p>Recapturing the love, laughter, and tears of her Italian-American childhood in East Harlem’s Little Italy, LuLu LoLo in a virtuoso performance—without intermission—and with inventive costume changes and songs—fills the stage with a non-stop parade of eleven family characters and vignettes such as Making Macaroni with Grandma LuLu, Great Aunt Lena Warding off the Evil Eye (Mal Occhio), The Seven Fishes of Christmas Eve Dinner and other scenes which  take the  audience back to the tenement life of her Italian immigrant grandparents. Theatergoers from all backgrounds will recognize themselves and their families in this poignant, exhilarating, and heartwarming show.  <br />
The first production of this play was performed in Williamsburgh at the Leonard  Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library in 2002.  For a review of Macaroni and Mal Occio by Arlene McKanic, Greenwich Village Gazette  go to www.hoast.org/artists/artistsLL.htm - 14k –</p>

<p>LuLu LoLo is an actor/playwright who has written and performed five acclaimed one-person plays Off-Broadway highlighting her immigrant family heritage and the dramatic struggle of women in New York City’s past. LuLu has performed at Metropolitan Playhouse, NY; FAR (Field Artist Residency) Space; Hofstra University; Columbia University; Stony Brook University; Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimo NYU; Garibaldi-Meucci Museum; Lower East Side Tenement Museum Theater; Raw Space, NY; 2004 Columbus, OH Gay and Lesbian Theatre Festival; and Provincetown Fringe Festival, MA. LuLu is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work has been exhibited worldwide. The New York Times and The Village Voice have reviewed her work. LuLu was also a contestant on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. </p>

THE PANORAMA CHALLENGE!<br />
A benefit for the City Reliquary<br />
Hosted by The Levys’ Unique New York!</p>

<p>Think you know New York? Brush up on your history, grab your geographical guidebooks, round up your friends and head out to the Queens Museum of Art on April 7th from 6 – 8pm for the City Reliquary’s fundraiser of the year: The Panorama Challenge! </p>

In honor of the 2004 campaign season, Ms. Gast created a set of Limited Edition Lady Presidential Candidates <br />
Collectible Plates, featuring the first ten women to run for President. The candidates and their stories are largely <br />
unknown, although a number of them were major players in their times.  Some of those included are: Victoria <br />
Woodhull, whose running mate was Frederick Douglass, was the first female stockbroker on Wall Street. Margaret <br />
Smith, Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, and Patsy Mink all served in the legislature in the mid-twentieth century, and <br />
Charlene Mitchell, a native New Yorker, has been a civil rights activist and union leader for 50 years. Thanks to Melissa <br />
Memory, Rodney Harrison, and Kevin Harper for generously lending their collections of original collectible Presidential <br />
Plates.</p>

<p>PEDRO GENAO's Life-size Abraham Lincoln Statue <br />
made of 100% hand-felted wool.<br />
Pedro moved to New York in 1992 from the Dominican Republic and soon became employed as a Maintenance <br />
Technician at the Steiner School, a part of the Waldorf school system.  There he watched some of the teachers' craft <br />
presentations working with wool.  He has since taught himself many finer techniques of NEEDLE FELTING and is now <br />
considered to be easily among the best in his field.  The Abraham Lincoln statue presented in our windows was <br />
created by Pedro during the course of 3 years and over 300 hours.  Pedro estimates that the statue was pointed with <br />
a single needle over 3 million times.  As he should be, Abraham is standing tall at over 6 feet 4 inches not including <br />
his 9-inch top hat and supports his own weight with absolutely NO INTERNAL ARMATURE.         </p>

<div class="blogbody">
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
 <br />
 As of January 1st at 12 o'clock midnight, we all ushered in the new year 2006 <br />
 (happy new year to all of you.)  At this same time, we at the City Reliquary, have also ushered in a new era in our mission to serve the people of New York City.  Effective today, January 1st 2006,<br />
 I am astoundingly proud to announce...<br />
 <strong><br />
 THE CITY RELIQUARY will be opening a new storefront MUSEUM <br />
(with gift shop!)<br />
 at 370 METROPOLITAN AVENUE at HAVEMEYER STREET,<br />
 just 2 blocks away from our current residence!<br />
  </strong><br />
 <br />
 This means GREAT OPPORTUNITIES for our museum and the scope of COMMUNITY OFFERINGS which we have dreamed of and planned for so long.  Soon to come will be: a museum dedicated to preserving and displaying the artifacts of New York History which often go overlooked by those larger museums, a public space for community events, an office for our Civic Organization meetings, educational classes, and neighborhood comradery, as well as a quintessential Museum Gift Shop complete with unique New York souvenirs, books, hand-made keepsakes, and the original "City Reliquary T-Shirt." Rest assured, this will not be another Williamsburgh boutique.  We'll be maintaining our window-museum style charm on Metropolitan Avenue as well as part of our displays on Grand Street and all the other things you love about the Reliquary.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 At this time of great new beginnings, I want to extend SINCERE APPRECIATION to all of our SUPPORTERS.  It is due to all your enthusiasm, involvement, and endurance of these e-mailings, that we have been able to begin this next step as a civic organization for-the-people, not-for-profit!<br />
 <br />
 OPENING DAY of new facility will be within the next few months, and we will be sure to invite the entire neighborhood to celebrate with us.  In the mean time, feel free to stop by and witness the MUSEUM-IN-PROGRESS.  <br />
 <br />
