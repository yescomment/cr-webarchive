<h3 class="title">2/27 BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE SOME RENT?</h3>

<p>Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser!<br />
Friday February 27th 7-11pm<br><br>Times are tough all around – rollercoaster stock markets, job losses by the hundreds of thousands, bipartisan bickering with no relief in sight. It’s even tougher for 501 (c) (3) non-profit Community Museums. So the City Reliquary is hosting a fundraiser to raise some of (last month’s!) rent. BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE SOME RENT? is a Modern Day Depression-Era Fundraiser held in our backroom and backyard. For a minimum $10 tax-deductible donation at the door, you can come and participate in scores of historical diversions and entertainments circa 1935.<br><br>The City Reliquary is proud to present:<br><br><strong>Pie the Landlord! That’s right</strong>: the City Reliquary will have our very own cigar-chomping, unshaven, smelly Landlord demanding our rent! Tell him where to shove it with a whipped cream pie in his face!<br /><br /><strong>Madame LuLu LoLo, Fortune Teller Extraordinaire</strong>: She Sees All and Knows All and Your Fortune Might Help Pay Our Rent!<br /><br /><strong>Hobo Photos a Go-G</strong>o: Take your picture in our hand painted carnival sign.  Remember the Recession of ’09 with a photographic keepsake!<br /><br /><strong>Depression-era movies</strong>: shown on the projector in the backyard. Laugh it up with Mae West, the Marx Brothers and James Cagney.<br /><br /><strong>Oil drum fires</strong>: (and more modern propane heaters) to keep you warm while you chill in the cold. All fires will be regulated carefully by official FDNY supervision! <br /><br /><strong>DIY Fingerless Gloves Table!</strong> Because nothing says Depression-chic than rockin’ a pair of fingerless gloves!<br /><br /><strong>Prohibition-era Beer</strong> provided by the Brooklyn Brewery and Depression-era “Rum” Punch provided by the City Reliquary at contemporary-recession era prices.<br /><br /><strong>DJ Stacher</strong> playing hits from the economically challenged 1930s (Harlem Jazz) and 1970s (early Rap); as well as Big Money tracks from the 1980s (disco) and 2000s (electro). Get down!<br /><br /><p>All entertainments and diversions will be priced at the Depression-friendly rates of $2-5 a pop. All proceeds go to help the City Reliquary pay (last month’s, and this one’s) rent. </p><br /><br /></p>
