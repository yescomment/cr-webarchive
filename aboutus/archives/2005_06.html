Her installations and drawings tenderly depict a cast of existential comic heroes.  She was the founder of the Cloud Seeding Circus touring collaborative arts group.  She has also applied her knowledge of materials to her own business, "Saints Alive" a statue restoration studio.  George has been at the backbone of the City Reliquary since its inception several years ago.  Her experience as a professor at the University of Florida taught her the ins and outs of academic bureaucracy.    You can view her artwork at the Cinders gallery on Havemeyer Street in Williamsburgh.  To learn more about her restoration work, go to www.brooklynsaints.info <br><br>
  
<strong>Bill Scanga</strong> - "Vice President of Collections" -background; Bill's collection of E.T. figurines and vintage glassware set a standard in the Community Collections window that has yet to be exceeded.

His skills also include knitting for taxidermy animals and trees, and restoring vintage bicycles.

<strong>Harley Spiller</strong> - "Resident Collector"  background;  Chairman of Franklin Furnace Non-Profit Organization, "Inspector Collector" educator and lecturer,  Harley presented his vast collection of Mr. T paraphernalia in the Community Collections window when it was the only of his many collections to be refused acceptance into the Queens Museum of Art.  At an event during the summer of 2005, fellow Reliquarians assisted Harley in obtaining an official count of his Chinese menu collection which earned him the title of "World’s Larges Menu Collection" from the Guiness Book of World Records.  Selections from this same collection have also been displayed at the Museum of Chinese in America and the Newark Museum.  Literally countless articles have been written in the New York Times about Harley’s collections and other areas of expertise.
