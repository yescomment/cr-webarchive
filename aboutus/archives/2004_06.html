<strong>Dave Herman</strong> - "President, Founder of the Museum"  <br>

George has been at the backbone of the City Reliquary since its inception in 2002.  Her experience as a professor at the University of Florida taught her the ins and outs of academic bureaucracy which she is now putting to even better use at the Reliquary.

His skills also include knitting for taxidermy animals and trees, and restoring vintage bicycles.  Bill is the standing president of the Brooklyn Civic Riders Bicycle Club.
