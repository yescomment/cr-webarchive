<strong>Dave Herman</strong> - "President, Founder of the Museum"  <br>

"I feel that our great city has so many gifts to offer.  It is not only our duty to seek out these gifts for ourselves, but also to offer something in return.  I hope this civic organization can serve as an everlasting gift to the citizens of New York."

George is an artist whose work is evidence of her broad talents and knowledge of diverse media.  Her installations and drawings tenderly depict a cast of existential comic heroes.  She was the founder of the Cloud Seeding Circus, a touring collaborative arts group.  She has also applied her knowledge of materials to her own business, "Saints Alive" a statue restoration studio.  George has been at the backbone of the City Reliquary since its inception in 2002.  Her experience as a professor at the University of Florida taught her the ins and outs of academic bureaucracy which she is now putting to even better use at the Reliquary.  To learn more about her restoration work, go to <a href="http://www.brooklynsaints.info">www.brooklynsaints.info</a> <br><em>george@cityreliquary.org</em><br><br>

His skills also include knitting for taxidermy animals and trees, and restoring vintage bicycles.  Bill is the standing president of the Brooklyn Civic Riders Bicycle Club.

As a geologist, Nik has worked on the design and excavation for several monumental civil works essential to every New Yorker's daily life.

Jesse James Arnold </strong> - "Master of Technologies"<br>
Jesse is wholly responsible for the cityreliquary.org website.  In addition he has been the resident digital photographer of CR events for 2 years and running.

Jesse has also been on the ground floor of the WCRM radio project since the earliest days of its conception prior to free103point9's involvement.  His knowledge of technologies and music work hand in hand as a crucial element which made the Citizen's Radio Music show a possibility.
