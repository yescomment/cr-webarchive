<h3 class="title">2005-2006 Board of Directors</h3>

<br>

<strong>Dave Herman</strong> - "President, Founder of the Museum"  <br>

"I feel that our great city has so many gifts to offer.  It is not only our duty to seek out these gifts for ourselves, but also to offer something in return.  I hope this civic organization can serve as an everlasting gift to the citizens of New York."
Background; fine arts, experienced museum preparator, NYC tourguide, currently FDNY firefighter with Hook & Ladder Co. 104 South 2nd St. & Bedford Avenue, protecting "The Southside" in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn

<br><br>
<strong>George Ferrandi</strong> -  
"Vice President of Operations"<br>
George is an artist whose work is evidence of her broad talents and knowledge of diverse media.  Her installations and drawings tenderly depict a cast of existential comic heroes.  She was the founder of the Cloud Seeding Circus, a touring collaborative arts group.  She has also applied her knowledge of materials to her own business, "Saints Alive" a statue restoration studio.  George has been at the backbone of the City Reliquary since its inception in 2002.  Her experience as a professor at the University of Florida taught her the ins and outs of academic bureaucracy which she is now putting to even better use at the Reliquary.  To see images of her artwork, go to <a href="http://georgeferrandi.com">georgeferrandi.com. </a> To learn more about her restoration work, go to <a href="http://www.brooklynsaints.info">www.brooklynsaints.info</a> <br><em>george@cityreliquary.org</em><br><br>
<strong>Bill Scanga</strong> - "Vice President of Collections"<br>
Bill's collection of E.T. figurines and vintage glassware set a standard in the Community Collections window that has yet to be exceeded.  Bill is a master miniature craftsman, runs a woodshop in Williamsburgh, and is a practicing artist who was featured at the Brooklyn Museum's Grand Re-Opening exhibition in 2005.  His skills also include knitting for taxidermy animals and trees, and restoring vintage bicycles.  Bill is the standing president of the Brooklyn Civic Riders Bicycle Club.  Stop by the Community Collections window anytime to see some of his handiwork.  <br><em>bill@cityreliquary.org</em>
 <br><br>
<strong>Nik Sokol</strong> - "Resident Geologist"<br>
Nik became a friend of the CR after discovering the "New Yorkers' Geology" display.  His first introduction included the donation of several astounding geological specimens.  As a geologist, Nik has worked on the design and excavation for several monumental civil works essential to every New Yorker's daily life.  Additionally, he has proven indispensable in the organization of CR events.  He also has a mysterious history in bronze casting, indie-rock bands, and Slovakian diplomacy.

non-profit arts organization. He's also known as "Inspector Collector," a

Selections from this same collection have been exhibited at the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, The Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas, Venezuela, The Queens Museum and elsewhere.

<strong>

His most recent achievement has been the removal of the dreaded "bumps" on the Williamsburgh Bridge's pedestrian and bicycle path. 
<br><br><br><br><strong>
Jesse James Arnold </strong> - "Master of Technologies"<br>
Jesse is wholly responsible for the cityreliquary.org website.  In addition he has been the resident digital photographer of CR events for 2 years and running.  Any technical and/or computer-related materials have been made possible through the voluntary actions of Mr. Jesse James Arnold.  Jesse has also been on the ground floor of the WCRM radio project since the earliest days of its conception prior to free103point9's involvement.  His knowledge of technologies and music work hand in hand as a crucial element which made the Citizen's Radio Music show a possibility.
