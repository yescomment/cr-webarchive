Everyone cheers as Marty holds the key.  Interesting side note: Anna Barie (pictured in the background ) has since become the City Reliquary Secretary of Communications.

At an official visit to the City Reliquary, Brooklyn Borough president comments to a reporter about the beautiful Statue of Liberty display.  With Marty, are his wife Jamie and myself, Dave, president of the Reliquary.

V.P. George Ferrandi and Taliah Lempert, a bicycle portrait artist, enjoy bagels provided by the local "Bagel Store," on Bedford Avenue.   It looks like they are sampling Marty's favorite - cinnamon raisin.

What a proud moment at the City Reliquary!  From left to right, the beaming representatives are; V.P. of Operations, George Ferrandi; President, Dave Herman; Brooklyn Borough President, Marty Markowitz; V.P. of Collections, Bill Scanga.  Such a piercing sincerity behind each smile.  And no squeeky ducks were even being used behind the photographers!

Marty looks smug as Dave checks to hear if the Liberty display audio happens to be working on this day.  Perhaps someday, the big audio re-habilitation grant will roll in and we'll get this sound working reliably.

Everyone seems to be pleasantly enjoying the recorded narration while viewing N.Y.C. artifacts such as a piece of the Williamsburgh Bridge and dentures found at Dead Horse Bay.  Both features of the best of the five boroughs, Brooklyn!

Now presenting....Mr. Bill Scanga, President of the City Reliquary Civic Riders Bicycle Club.  (You may also notice the discarded V.P. sash just at his feet.)

Marty said, "Hmm...Now i'll be honest.  I can tell right off the bat that this is Junior's cheescake."   Yes, of course, in a way it is his job to know Brooklyn's most famous cheescake that well.  Blindfold or not.

There is a tie for first place.  And the winners are...
David "Scout" McQueen representing Williamsburgh with a new homemade recipe.  And Patrick Barth from Red Hook with his tried and true methods.  Coincidentally,  the two that tied happened to be the only homemade cakes in the contest.  I guess Marty really has good taste.

Marty came prepared.  The certificates presented to the City Reliquary from Brooklyn Borough Hall actually included pictures of the Reliquary printed on them!

Marty delivers a poignant address to the friends of the Reliquary on one of the coldest Saturdays of the season.  The people of Williamsburgh who came to see him all paid close attention as his comments are particularly important regarding the re-zoning of our waterfront.  Just days earlier, Marty had defended the people of our neighborhood when he voted against City Hall's ill-considered city plan for North Brooklyn.  We hope in the future, City Hall will send somemone across the East River before deciding our fate.

Here are the friends of the Reliquary.  The reason why the City Reliquary is now officially "For the People - Not for Profit."

<p>It was quite a cold morning on our corner of Grand and Havemeyer Sts. in Williamsburgh.  But the people prevailed.  A little Brooklyn-baked cheesecake helped out!</p>
